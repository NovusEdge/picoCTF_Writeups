### Problem Statement:
```txt
There is a nice program that you can talk to by using this command in a shell:

$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 43239, but it doesn't speak English...
```

---

The command given is invoking the `netcat` tool.

When this is executed in the shell, we get an output:

```txt

One can clearly guess that these may be a the numerical representations of ascii characters.

To decode the flag from these, we may use a script similar to `decode_nums.py`.


First, let's get the output into a readable text file:

```shell
$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 43239 > output.txt
```

Now, we can run the python script to decode the data from `output.txt`

##### Output:
```shell
$ python3 decode_nums.py output.txt

The flag is: picoCTF{g00d_k1tty!_n1c3_k1tty!_7c0821f5}
Time Taken: 5.793571472167969e-05
```

#### Flag:
    picoCTF{g00d_k1tty!_n1c3_k1tty!_7c0821f5}
